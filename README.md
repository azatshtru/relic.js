# relic

relic is a fast frontend framework, requires no compilation, and doesn't manage a virtual DOM, giving you systematically a near-Vanilla experience, while providin APIs to help compose UIs ergonomically.


**why?**
Every project has different needs and a single high level framework cannot fit every use case, relic is designed to be a mid-level framework where it is perfectly capable of composing any webpage with ease, yet allows implementation of high level constructs suited to any project's specific needs.

relic is designed to be explicit and direct, therefore no hidden magic or automatic inference of any kind. Nothing more and nothing less happens other than what you write.
