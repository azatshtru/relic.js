# relic

> No compilers, no virtual DOMs. Just pure, native, modern JavaScript.

relic is a fast frontend framework, requires no compilation, and doesn't manage a virtual DOM, giving you systematically a near-Vanilla experience.
relic is designed to be explicit and direct, therefore no hidden magic or automatic inference of any kind. Nothing more and nothing less happens other than what you write.

relic has three parts:
1. signals for reactivity
2. anvil for composability
3. quark for seamless routing
